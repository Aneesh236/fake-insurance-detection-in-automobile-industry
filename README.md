# fake-insurance-detection-using-ADASYN-and-SMOTE
This is a python code to identify insurance fraudulence occuring in automobile industry. 
I've used 4 machine learning algorithms and compared their individual results.
As you know, the target column has imbalanced classes 
Therefore, to solve the imbalanceness, I've applied oversampling technique
So, I've used SMOTE and ADASYN, two oversampling techniques and trained each models again
The results were excellent acquiring a 97% accuracy using random forest classifier
